    "Montreal, the 2nd most populated city in Canada has more than 4 millions population with a slow growth of 0.73% average every year. It also has a population density of 4,517 per KM², covering 431.5 km² of land. Montreal is also known as the city with 2nd largest economy in Canada by having a variety of businesses implementing themselves out there. As a place with growing work possibilities, many people consider moving there. On the other hand, you can expect traffic with that much people and the economical activity. Along traffic, car accidents is also a frequent thing in the french city and severity of the events are ranging from minor damage to casualties. \n",
    "\n",
    "If an event had to happen, We would like to know case study will use machine learning algorithms to predict future event severity. This process targets the city's civil engineers and any road responsible in case those incidents are street related. This could also interest the ones who would like to open a car body shop to repair vehicules related to these events.\n",
